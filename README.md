# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
### Performing an analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
Analyze the outcomes of kickstarter events to identify correlations between 

## Analysis and Challenges
The dataset used for this analysis contained information on 4,115 kickstart campaigns across multiple fields of interest. For this report, we focused only on campaigns identifying as theatre. 
The data was filtered to only include theatre campaigns and was grouped by the month in which the campaign was initiated. This method provided the total quantity of campaigns that were initiated in each month. The data was further organized to break this total into the quantity of campaigns for each of the following outcomes:
  - Successful
  - Failed
  - Cancelled

In addition to grouping by the month, the data was also grouped by the *goal* amount that was specifed at the time the kickstarter was initiated. The quantity of each of the outcomes was captured across the following goal amount ranges:
  - Less than $1,000
  - $1,000-$4,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $10,000-$9,999
  - $15,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $25,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $35,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $45,000-$9,999
  - $50,000 or more

Two analysis were completed as for this report and are described in more detail in the next sections. The data referenced was gathered from 1,363 kickstarter campaigns associated with theatre. This included plays, musicals and spaces. Data reference is from 2010-2017

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns by Date Initiated (month)
*See Table 1.1 for data included in the graph below:*
![outcome by date](https://github.com/michaelsullivan0220/kickstarter-analysis/blob/michaelsullivan0220-patch-1/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
The graph above shows the total number of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns based on the month they were intiated. The month with the highest total campaigns intitiated (TCI) was the month of May with 163. This is followed by June (153) and July (138). Months with the lowest TCI are December (75), November(88), and March (92). 
May, June & July also saw the highest total of successful campaigns at 111, 100, & 87 respectively giving those months the highest probability to succeed. Campaigns started in May were successful in over two-thirds of of cases (66.9%). June (65.4%) and July (63.0%) show similar but slightly less success. the month with the lowest rate of success was December. Of all campaigns initiated in December, less than half (48.3%) went on to hit their goal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns by Goal Amount ($)
*See Table 1.2 for data included in the graph below:*
![outcome by goal](https://github.com/michaelsullivan0220/kickstarter-analysis/blob/michaelsullivan0220-patch-1/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
The graph above shows the total number of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns based on the goal amount that was set when the campaign was intiated.
To draw meaninigful conclusions for this analysis, focus was put on campaigns with less than $10,000 goal amounts. 84.9% of all campaigns for plays had goal amounts of less than %10,000. Success rates for campaigns that had a goal amounts in the ranges of $35,000-$39,999 & $40,000-$44,999 were at 66.7% but cannot be confidently used as there were only 9 campaigns within these categories. 
Campaigns with a goal amount of less than $1,000 had the highest success rate at 75.81%. As expected, these rates decline as the goal amount increases. Campaigns with a goal amount of $15,000-$19,999 yielded a 50% success rate across 24 kickstarters.
The goal range with the most campaigns was $1,000-$4,999. 534 campaigns with a goal in this range saw a 72.6% success rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There are not enough campaigns with a goal amount over $15,000 to draw meaningful conclusions.
## Results
Starting a kickstarter campaign for a theatre project would have the best chance for success if intitiated in May, June or July. The data shows that a 65.2% chance of success for similar campaigns. In contrast, the holiday season should be avoided as a
