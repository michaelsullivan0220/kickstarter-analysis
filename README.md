## Analysis and Challenges
The dataset used for this analysis contained information on 4,115 kickstart campaigns across multiple fields of interest. For this report, we focused only on campaigns identifying as theatre. 
The data was filtered to only include theatre campaigns and was grouped by the month in which the campaign was initiated. This method provided the total quantity of campaigns that were initiated in each month. The data was further organized to break this total into the quantity of campaigns for each of the following outcomes:
  - Successful
  - Failed
  - Cancelled

In addition to grouping by the month, the data was also grouped by the *goal* amount that was specifed at the time the kickstarter was initiated. The quantity of each of the outcomes was captured across the following goal amount ranges:
  - $4,999 or less
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $10,000-$9,999
  - $15,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $25,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
  - $35,000-$9,999
  - $5,000-$9,999
